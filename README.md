# *IoT-Based Smart Healthcare Monitoring System* 🏥📡

## *1. Project Overview* 🚀  
This system is designed to continuously monitor critical health parameters in real-time using IoT technology. By integrating sensors like *MAX30100* (for heart rate and SpO2), *DS18B20* (for temperature), and an *ECG sensor*, the system ensures accurate and timely tracking of vital signs. If any metric deviates from the safe threshold, the system triggers immediate alerts to prompt rapid intervention. 🚑

## *2. Key Features*

### *2.1 Real-Time Monitoring* 💓📈  
Continuously monitors body temperature, heart rate, SpO2 levels, and ECG signals.

### *2.2 Instant Alerts* 🚨  
Alerts activate automatically when vital signs fall outside the safe range.

### *2.3 Cloud Integration* 🌐  
Data is transmitted every 10 seconds to *Ubidots*, allowing for remote monitoring and analysis.

### *2.4 Visual and Display* 🖥️  
Displays real-time health data for local viewing and quick assessment.

### *2.5 Easy Wi-Fi Setup* 📡  
Built-in Wi-Fi (via *ESP8266*) ensures smooth cloud communication.
