# *IoT-Based Smart Healthcare Monitoring System* 🏥📡

## *1. Project Overview* 🚀  
This system is designed to continuously monitor critical health parameters in real-time using IoT technology. By integrating sensors like *MAX30100* (for heart rate and SpO2), *DS18B20* (for temperature), and an *ECG sensor*, the system ensures accurate and timely tracking of vital signs. If any metric deviates from the safe threshold, the system triggers immediate alerts to prompt rapid intervention. 🚑
